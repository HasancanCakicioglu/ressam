## Inspiration
"Planets" was inspired by the idea of being able to play a slide puzzle of animations instead of texts, numbers, or images.

## Highlights:
* Slide puzzle with an animation
* Auto solver
* 3 different puzzle levels
* Made for all screens
* Available for web, ios, android & windows

## What's next for Planets
Going forward, I have the following points that I would love to add in "Planets"
* Adding an efficient auto solver, using a heuristic search algorithm - as the current solver algorithm, though easy to understand, is too slow.
* Improve the image and animation assets, namely the planets, the landscape images, and the overall theme of the app.
* Support for extreme(6x6) & pro(7x7) puzzle levels
* Add support for a different language.
* Most importantly, discovering a different way to slice up the puzzle pieces to improve performance.
